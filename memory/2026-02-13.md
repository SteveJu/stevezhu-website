## Context Management Issues Resolved 🔧
- **Problem**: Steve Ju (朱哥) experiencing LLM request errors: "input length and max_tokens exceed context limit: 172020 + 34048 > 200000"
- **Root cause**: Compaction mode was "safeguard" (reactive only) instead of "default" (proactive)
- **Solution implemented**: 
  - Changed compaction mode to "default" for auto-compression before hitting limits
  - Added context pruning (cache-ttl 30m) to clean old tool outputs
  - Enabled memory flush before compaction (8K soft threshold)
  - Set reserveTokensFloor to 30K for adequate headroom
- **Result**: Future long conversations will auto-compress instead of erroring

## Model Cost Optimization 💰
- **Request**: Steve wants to use cheaper models daily, expensive models only for complex tasks
- **Change made**: 
  - Primary model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514 (cheaper)
  - Fallback model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-6 (premium)
- **Cost savings**: ~5x cheaper for daily conversations
- **Usage**: Manual `/model` command to force Opus when needed

## Memory Check 🧠
- **Steve's request**: Asked what I remember about our interactions
- **My recall summary**: Covered website project, career goals, technical setups, recent optimizations
- **Memory sources**: MEMORY.md + daily logs from 2/10-2/12
- **Key themes**: Personal website development, AI career transition, cost optimization, technical problem-solving

## Today's Technical Work
- Gateway restarts successful for both config changes
- WhatsApp/Telegram connections stable
- Memory search currently disabled (missing API keys for embedding providers)

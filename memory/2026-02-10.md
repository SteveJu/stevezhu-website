## First Boot
- Came online ~22:25 EST
- 朱哥 set up my identity: Zack Zhu, professional assistant, sharp/efficient/honest
- Key principles: no fluff, always honest, verify before answering, accuracy > speed
- 朱哥 is a SWE at Meta, Manhattan office, lives in Jersey City
- Previously at Bank of America (3.5 years), came to US from China for college
- Communication via WhatsApp → then switched to Telegram

## Telegram Setup
- Created bot @openzackbot via BotFather
- Had to enable telegram plugin (plugins.entries.telegram.enabled was false)
- Pairing code T9QT4QU9 approved for user id 5498041262 (Steve Ju @TeveJJ)
- Telegram fully working as of ~22:48 EST

## Personal Website Project
- 朱哥 wants a personal website: resume + photography portfolio
- Wants fancy animations, high-end and vivid
- Tech stack: Next.js + React + Tailwind + Framer Motion
- Structure: Hero → About → Experience (timeline) → Skills → Photography (album collections) → Contact
- Photography: album-based structure, mostly portrait photos of friends from outings
- Dark theme preferred (better for photo showcase)
- Deploy to Vercel (free)
- Domain: steveju.com — expired 2025-11-30, in redemptionPeriod on name.com, needs redemption
- Resume saved to workspace/resume.pdf
- Columbia MS CS (ML track), Stanford AI program, OSU BS CSE
- Meta (Mar 2025-present) - recently switched to Instagram Youth Protection team, focus: bully & harassment detection, building AI data pipeline with Llama4/Gemini to identify problematic anonymous school accounts
- BofA (Jul 2021-Mar 2025), Research at OSU

## Career Development Goal
- 朱哥 wants to transition from traditional SWE to AI-focused engineer 
- Concerned about traditional SWE being replaced by AI
- Wants learning plan to maximize AI skills and become AI engineer
- Has strong foundation: Columbia ML track, Stanford AI, currently building AI pipeline at Meta

## Usage & Economy Strategy  
- 朱哥 current plan: Claude Pro $20/month + $5 API credits
- Switched from Opus to Sonnet to save costs
- Daily 2AM compaction job set up to manage context size (>50k triggers cleanup)
- Monitor usage regularly, suggest upgrades when needed
- Incremental development approach to avoid rate limits

## Automation & Workflow (Feb 11)
- Set up automated development workflow:
  - 10 PM: Daily work plan announcement
  - 2:10 AM - 9 AM: Autonomous development window  
  - 9 AM: Morning progress report
  - 2 AM: Daily compaction if context >50k tokens
- Night development session encountered file persistence issues - files reported created but not actually written to filesystem
- Morning manual project creation successful: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind running on localhost:3000

## Open Source & Career Discussion (Feb 11)
- Brainstormed AI-related open source projects
- 朱哥 interested in transitioning from traditional SWE to AI-focused engineering
- Has strong foundation but wants systematic learning plan (to be developed)

## Other
- Email set up for me: openzackzhu@gmail.com
- Mac mini can stay on with screen off, just needs energy saver settings configured
- VSCode extensions needed: ES7 React snippets, Auto Rename Tag, Prettier, Tailwind IntelliSense
